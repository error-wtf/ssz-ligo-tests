# L1 Excluded / Diagnostic Report — GW240925

Generated: 2026-05-18 23:49:58  
Detector: L1 (LIGO Livingston)  
Event: GW240925 (trigger GPS 1411261107.984)  
Status: **DQ_FLAGGED_DIAGNOSTIC_ONLY**

## Why L1 Is Diagnostic-Only

L1 passes all CBC quality flags (CAT1/2/3, DATA) according to the
GWOSC release DQ bitmask. However, a strong broadband in-band power
excess is observed (band-power ratio trigger/off-source = 2.28)
that is NOT explained by any available DQ flag.

Additionally, the CW hardware injection flag (NO_CW_HW_INJ) is not
set ("not certified injection-free") for the entire 4096-second
release segment at both detectors. This is a file-wide constant, not
a trigger-specific event, and cannot by itself explain the broadband
excess.

## L1 DQ Status (VERIFIED_FROM_HDF5)

| Flag | Value | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| DATA | 1 | PASS |
| CBC_CAT1 | 1 | PASS |
| CBC_CAT2 | 1 | PASS |
| CBC_CAT3 | 1 | PASS |
| BURST_CAT1 | 1 | PASS |
| BURST_CAT2 | 1 | PASS |
| BURST_CAT3 | 1 | PASS |
| STOCH_CAT1 | 1 | PASS |
| CW_CAT1 | 1 | PASS (100% over full file) |

## L1 In-Band Diagnostics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Band | 20.0--210.0 Hz |
| Band-power ratio (trigger/off-source) | 2.28 |
| H1 band-power ratio for comparison | 0.76 |
| H1/L1 ratio difference | 1.52 |
| Assessment | ANOMALOUS — excess not explained by GWOSC DQ |

## Possible Explanations (Unresolved)

```
1. Real GW signal in L1
   GW240925 is a confirmed event. L1 would be expected to show
   elevated in-band power. This may simply be the signal.
   -> Would require matched-filter SNR comparison vs H1.

2. Non-stationary noise transient
   A noise event not captured by the 1Hz DQ bitmask.
   -> Needs offline omicron/iDQ to rule out.

3. PSD estimation mismatch
   Off-source window at -200s may not represent noise at trigger time.
   -> Robust multi-window PSD (already done) showed consistent excess.

4. CW hardware injection contribution
   Narrow-band only — cannot explain broadband excess.
   -> Already ruled out by bandwidth argument.
```

## What L1 Can Be Used For

```
DIAGNOSTIC USE ONLY:
  - Qualitative comparison with H1
  - Visual inspection of spectral excess
  - Motivating LIGO DQ question

NOT USABLE FOR:
  - H1/L1 coherence-based SSZ evidence
  - Multi-detector twist amplitude claim
  - Any claim requiring clean L1 noise characterization
```

## Reinstatement Criteria

```
L1 can be reinstated as a full coherence partner when:
  1. Offline DQ (omicron/iDQ/hveto) confirms no glitch at trigger time
  OR
  2. LIGO/GWOSC confirms the L1 segment is usable for coherence tests
  OR
  3. A physically motivated explanation for the excess is found
     (e.g., confirmed matched-filter SNR consistent with the event)
```
