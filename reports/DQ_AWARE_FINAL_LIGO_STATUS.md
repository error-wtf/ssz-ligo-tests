## Verified DQ Facts (VERIFIED_FROM_HDF5)


Source: run_dq_bit_provenance.py  —  DQ_BIT_MAPPING_STATUS: VERIFIED_FROM_HDF5
All names and descriptions read from HDF5 datasets DQShortnames / DQDescriptions
/ InjShortnames / InjDescriptions directly.

H1 DQ at trigger:
  DATA=1, CBC_CAT1=1, CBC_CAT2=1, CBC_CAT3=1
  BURST_CAT1=1, BURST_CAT2=1, BURST_CAT3=1, STOCH_CAT1=1
  CW_CAT1=0  (0% over entire 4096s file — constant, not trigger-specific)
  NO_CW_HW_INJ=0  (0% over entire 4096s file — constant)

L1 DQ at trigger:
  DATA=1, CBC_CAT1=1, CBC_CAT2=1, CBC_CAT3=1
  BURST_CAT1=1, BURST_CAT2=1, BURST_CAT3=1, STOCH_CAT1=1, CW_CAT1=1
  NO_CW_HW_INJ=0  (0% over entire 4096s file — constant)

Key interpretation:
  - L1 passes ALL CBC quality flags (CAT1/2/3) — no vetoed CBC glitch
  - H1 CW_CAT1=0 is file-wide, not trigger-specific
  - NO_CW_HW_INJ unset for both = "not certified injection-free for CW"
    over the entire segment; cannot explain broadband L1 excess
  - L1 broadband excess remains unexplained by GWOSC release DQ products


## What This Means

H1 passes all CBC quality flags and has a normal band-power ratio
(trigger/off-source = 0.76). It can be used for
exploratory single-detector strain analysis.

L1 passes all CBC quality flags but shows a strong broadband
in-band power excess (ratio = 2.28) that is not
explained by any available GWOSC DQ flag. The NO_CW_HW_INJ
flag is unset for the entire 4096-second file at both detectors —
a file-level property, not a trigger artifact. Until this is
clarified by offline DQ tools, L1 should not be used as a coherence
partner for SSZ claim-level tests.

## Data Context — Precise Interpretation

The GWOSC release products are calibrated, quality-classified products
intended for specific analysis classes (primarily CBC/GR detection).

```
CBC_CAT2/CAT3 clean means:
  For CBC/compact-binary analysis, no vetoed glitch by these criteria.

CBC_CAT2/CAT3 clean does NOT mean:
  This segment is neutral in every frequency band and for
  every alternative analysis metric.
```

The correct framing for our situation:

```
The released products are suitable for their intended CBC/GR
analysis context, but not sufficient for our anti-circular
non-GR forward-model test without additional DQ/line/injection
clarification for L1.
```

Additional structural reasons this data cannot serve as final evidence:

```
1. LIGO measures detector strain, not direct telescope observables.
2. PE/QNM posterior products are model-dependent (GR/Kerr-oriented);
   they cannot be treated as metric-neutral inputs for an SSZ test.
3. L1 shows an unexplained broadband power anomaly.
4. CW-HW-injection/DQ context is active and not fully resolved.
5. H1/L1 coherence is therefore only partially usable.
6. SSZ has no final locked interferometer forward model yet.
```

What the data CAN be used for:

```
VALID USES:
  - Pipeline construction, access, PSD estimation
  - H1/L1 strain diagnostics and residual checks
  - Exploratory SSZ forward-model branches (synthetic)
  - H1-only single-detector exploratory tests

NOT VALID FOR (currently):
  - Final SSZ proof or falsification
  - H1/L1 coherence-based SSZ claim
  - Treating PE posteriors as metric-neutral SSZ inputs
```

This is NOT:

```
NOT: LIGO data is wrong or manipulated
NOT: GW240925 is not a real event
NOT: SSZ explains the L1 anomaly
NOT: The pipeline is wrong
NOT: LIGO has misrepresented the data
```

## Path Forward

```
Option A: Other event(s)
  Run same pipeline on additional O4 events with clean H1 and L1.
  Multi-event consistent H1/L1 twist response would be meaningful.

Option B: H1-only exploratory
  Use H1 alone for scale/twist sensitivity studies.
  Cannot test H1/L1 differential response, but can validate pipeline.

Option C: LIGO question
  Submit the question below to LIGO/GWOSC.
  If offline DQ confirms L1 is clean, rerun coherence analysis.

Option D: Wait for offline DQ products
  If omicron/iDQ becomes available for this release, rerun.
```

## LIGO Question (ready to send)

```
@LIGO We do not claim the data are wrong. But for a non-GR forward-model
test (source-propagation twist branch, anti-circular) we cannot treat
current PE/QNM posterior products as metric-neutral, and L1 shows a
DQ/injection-context ambiguity in our state-vector check:

  - L1 has a persistent 20-210 Hz band-power excess
    (trigger/off-source ratio ~2.28 vs H1 ~0.76)
  - CBC_CAT2/CAT3 are clean at both detectors
  - NO_CW_HW_INJ is unset for both detectors over the full
    4096-second segment (constant, file-wide, not trigger-specific)
  - Bit names verified directly from HDF5 DQShortnames/InjShortnames

Questions:
  1. Which GWOSC products are recommended for the most anti-circular
     strain-level test (i.e., least GR/Kerr-model-dependent)?
  2. Are offline DQ products (omicron, iDQ, hveto, line-noise)
     available for GW240925?
  3. Is L1 intended for broadband H1/L1 coherence tests in this
     release, or should it be treated as diagnostic only?
  4. Is the L1 band-power excess a known feature of this segment?

Thank you.
