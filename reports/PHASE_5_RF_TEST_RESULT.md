# Phase 5: Preregistered QNM R_f Test - Final Result

**Task ID:** LIGO_PHASE_5_PREREGISTERED_QNM_RF_TEST  
**Status:** BLOCKED (Phase 5C - GR Reference Computation)  
**Date:** 2026-05-14  

---

## Executive Summary

The preregistered QNM R_f test **could not be completed** due to a technical blocker: **no validated local method to compute GR-predicted QNM frequency from final mass and spin**.

### What Was Accomplished

| Phase | Status | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 5A: Field Identification Lock | ✅ COMPLETE | 5,050 candidate fields identified, QNM frequencies found in ringdown |
| 5B: Anti-Circularity Check | ✅ COMPLETE | Status: PARTIALLY_COUPLED (test allowed with caveats) |
| 5C: R_f Computation | ❌ **BLOCKED** | Missing GR QNM computation capability |
| 5D: Threshold Decision | ⏸️ NOT REACHED | R_f not computed |

---

## Preregistered Test Definition

```
R_f := f_QNM,measured / f_QNM,GR(reference)

Mode: l=m=2, n=0 (fixed preregistered)

Where:
- f_QNM,measured = posterior median of observed QNM frequency
- f_QNM,GR(reference) = GR-predicted QNM from final mass/spin posterior
```

## Locked Fields (Phase 5A)

### Measured QNM Frequencies

| IFO | File | HDF5 Path | Median f [Hz] | Samples | Status |
|-----|------|-----------|---------------|---------|--------|
| Hanford (H1) | rd_GW250207_Kerr220_8M_singleIFO_prod_2048Hz_evol_20Ksamps.hdf5 | H1_only/f | 243.2 | 20,000 | ✅ Locked |
| Livingston (L1) | rd_GW250207_Kerr220_8M_singleIFO_prod_2048Hz_evol_20Ksamps.hdf5 | L1_only/f | 253.8 | 20,000 | ✅ Locked |

### GR Reference Inputs

| Parameter | Source File | HDF5 Path | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| final_mass | GW250207_combinedPHM_cal_metafile.hdf5 | C00:*/priors/samples/final_mass | ✅ Locked |
| final_spin | GW250207_combinedPHM_cal_metafile.hdf5 | C00:*/priors/samples/final_spin | ✅ Locked |

### Missing: GR QNM Computation

| Required | Status | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| f_QNM,GR = f(M, χ; mode=220) | ❌ **NOT AVAILABLE** | No validated local QNM library |

---

## Anti-Circularity Status (Phase 5B)

**Classification: PARTIALLY_COUPLED**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Different data products | ✅ ringdown vs combinedPHM |
| Different analysis methods | ✅ Kerr fit vs Bayesian PE |
| Same underlying event | ⚠️ Both GW250207 |
| Same theoretical framework | ⚠️ Both assume GR/Kerr |
| Independent determination | ✅ No circular fitting |

**Implication:** Test permitted with explicit "partially coupled" caveats.

## Blockage Detail (Phase 5C)

### Blocker: GR Reference Computation

To complete R_f computation, f_QNM,GR(reference) must be calculated from:
- final_mass ~ 60-80 M_sun
- final_spin ~ 0.6-0.8
- mode l=m=2, n=0

**Required:** Validated GR/Kerr QNM computation

**Available locally:** None

**Options rejected:**
- ❌ Unvalidated analytic approximations
- ❌ Literature formulas without implementation check
- ❌ Estimation without uncertainty propagation

**Protocol compliance:** Marked BLOCKED per preregistered safety rules.

---

## Data Products Used

✅ **Used:**
- GW250207_combinedPHM_cal_metafile.hdf5 (for final_mass, final_spin)
- rd_GW250207_Kerr220_8M_singleIFO_prod_2048Hz_evol_20Ksamps.hdf5 (for f_QNM,measured)

❌ **Excluded (blocked):**
- fti/* (0-byte symlink placeholders)
- tiger/* (0-byte symlink placeholders)

---

## Decision Against Preregistered Thresholds

**Status:** NOT REACHED

Because R_f could not be computed, no comparison to preregistered thresholds is possible.

| Threshold | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| SSZ_FALSIFIED_BY_THIS_TEST | Cannot assess |
| SSZ_SUPPORTED_BY_THIS_TEST | Cannot assess |
| INCONCLUSIVE | Cannot assess |

---

## Explicit Safety Declarations

| Declaration | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| **R_f was NOT computed** | ✅ True - Blocked at Phase 5C |
| **SSZ was NOT tested** | ✅ True - Cannot test without R_f |
| **No GR claims made** | ✅ True - No results to claim |
| **FTI/TIGER not used** | ✅ True - Blocked as 0-byte files |
| **No data modified** | ✅ True - Read-only inspection only |

---

## Caveats and Limitations

1. **Technical blocker:** Missing QNM computation capability prevented test completion
2. **Partial circularity:** Measured and predicted QNM share theoretical framework
3. **Single event:** Only GW250207 has complete ringdown + metafile data
4. **Calibration uncertainty:** Not fully propagated
5. **Missing validation products:** FTI/TIGER blocked as supplementary checks

---

## Recommendations

### To Complete This Test

1. **Install QNM library:**
   ```bash
   pip install qnm
   # Validate with known M=100, χ=0.7 → f≈XXX Hz
   ```

2. **Re-run Phase 5C** with validated GR QNM computation

3. **Complete Phase 5D** threshold comparison

### Alternative Approaches

| Approach | Effort | Validity |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Install qnm library | Low | ✅ Preferred |
| Use pre-computed LIGO values | Medium | ✅ If available |
| Literature formula with citation | Low | ⚠️ Exploratory only |
| Skip to different event | High | ⏸️ GW240925 ringdown not found |

---

## Next Step

**Install validated QNM computation library and re-run Phase 5C.**

Do not:
- ❌ Use unvalidated approximations
- ❌ Claim provisional results as definitive
- ❌ Ignore the PARTIALLY_COUPLED anti-circularity status
